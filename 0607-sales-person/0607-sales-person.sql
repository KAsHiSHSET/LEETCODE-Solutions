-- You start with the SalesPerson table.

-- 2. LEFT JOIN Orders o ON s.sales_id = o.sales_id
-- You bring in matching orders made by each salesperson (if any).

-- If a salesperson has no orders, you still keep the row â€” with NULL in Orders.

-- 3. LEFT JOIN Company c ON o.com_id = c.com_id
-- For each order, you attach the company info.

-- If the order's com_id doesn't match any company, c.name will be NULL.
